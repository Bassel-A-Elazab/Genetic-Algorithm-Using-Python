# Genetic-Algorithm-Using-Python

# Introduction
  * A genetic algorithm is a heuristic search method used in artificial intelligence and computing. <br/>
  * Algorithm is started with a set of solutions (represented by chromosomes) called <b>population</b>. <br/>
  Solutions from one population are taken and used to form a new population. This is motivated by a hope, that the new population will be better than the old one. Solutions which are selected to form new solutions (offspring) are selected according to their fitness - the more suitable they are the more chances they have to reproduce.
