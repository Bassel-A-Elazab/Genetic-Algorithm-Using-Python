# Genetic-Algorithm-Using-Python

# Introduction
  * A genetic algorithm is a heuristic search method used in artificial intelligence and computing. <br/>
  * Algorithm is started with a set of solutions (represented by chromosomes) called <b>population</b>. <br/>
  * Solutions from one population are taken and used to form a new population.<br/> 
  * This is motivated by a hope, that the new population will be better than the old one.<br/>
  * Solutions which are <b>selected</b> to form new solutions (offspring) are selected according to their fitness 
  - the more suitable they are the more chances they have to reproduce.
